The GPS Data Logger reads standard NMEA strings from a serially connected GPS
unit to include units connected via virtual COM ports (e.g. A Garmin eTrex
hand held connected via USB using Franson GPS Gate Client to read the data). The
UI displays Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Heading, Current Speed, Average Speed
and the current fix mode of the GPS unit. Logging is selectable to log all
messages or to log only messages above a set speed. This feature is helpful to
prevent extra logging when starting and stopping. All logged coordinates can be saved to KML format for viewing path in programs
such as Google earth.
